                Hi! My name is Alex, and I'm a web developer living in Upstate New york. I am currently working at Cornell University as a Drupal Webmaster and Web Devloper, but I am open to great new opportunities. If you are looking for a developer in New York State, or someone to work remotely, and you like what you see here, feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me!</a>

                        I created a new template for the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine's Alumni web page. I worked with Alumni Affairs and Development to create new styles that captured the vision of their staff.

                    <p>
                        I created a calculator originally for the freeCodeCamp front end certification. This was something that I put together quickly, and the original version is still available on codepen.io. However, a few years later I totally reworked this to look and feel closer to my original vision.

            <p>
                Currently, I work at The Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine as a Drupal Webmaster and Web Developer. My primary responsibilities include:
            </p>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
                <li>Staying in contact with several content managers to ensure they have all they need to be successful</li>
                <li>Developing new templates, layouts, and widgets to meet client needs</li>
                <li>Making necessary changes to styles and content to meet WCAG 2.0 Accessibility standards</li>
                <li>Developing new PHP features to extend Drupal template </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some of the things I've been doing outside of my regular responsibilities include:
            </p>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
                <li>Working closely with another developer to test and implement a CI/CD process</li>
                <li>Giving presentations on topics related to specific technologies (such as CSS) and Accessibility.</li>
                <li>Training content managers on the use of auditing and analytical tools, such as SiteImprove</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub-heading" style="color:#002367;">MPL Inc.</h3>
            <p>
                Before working at Cornell, I worked for a small local electronics manufacturer in Ithaca, NY. While my job as an inspector wasn't directly related to web/software development, I still took a lot from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As my day-to-day work involved using a microscope to inspect fine details on Printed Circuit Boards, I found my attention to detail vastly improved. Since we were often working with a wide variety of assemblies, a lot of the tools and techniques that are appropriate for one job are not right for others. This put me into a mindset of looking at the bigger picture of a task before I start deciding how to approach it, which is something that I have seen cause an improvement in my project work.
            </p>
            <p>
                A large aspect of my particular responsibility was to operate an Automated Optical Inspection machine. As this was a machine that just about every assembly passed through, it was critical for me to develop a workflow that worked well to ensure that every assembly was inspected thuroughly, but efficiently. My drive to optimize not only the programs for the AOI machine, but also my process for running assemblies through, is something that I taken with me into my project work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, since this was run by a computer that was not connected to the internet, I sometimes found myself looking for things to do while I would wait for some of the larger or more complicated assemblies to run through the program. One process I had to repeat fairly often was reformatting data from the assemblers into a format that the AOI program would accept. I had discovered the Powershell documentation on the computer, and wrote a few scripts to automatically format files for AOI, in order to save the company time, and make training future employees easier. The fact that I did all of this in time that would have otherwise been wasted is something that I am really proud about.
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading" style="color:#0046C1;">Best Buy</h2>
            <p>
                Before working at MPL, I worked at Best Buy for a few years. I worked in multiple departments, including Inventory/Merchandising, Sales (Mobile and Computing) and Customer Service. This gave me a great opportunity to learn as much as I could about all kinds of products, technologies, and customer needs. I also got used to different systems, processes, and settings as I moved positions, and as the company adopted new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I loved Best Buy for their company values, and for their solutions-based approach to sales. I always took pride in living the core values while I was at Best Buy, and I still try to follow them, as some have become my own core values. I also go into client meetings with the same mindset that I would go into sales at Best Buy with: building a complete solution to meet every need.
