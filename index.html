            </h2>
            <p>
                I have been working on a variety of front-end technologies, and plan to expand my knowledge onto other web and software development technologies in the near future.

                    <h4>HTML5 and CSS3</h4>
                    <p>I have been building a solid foundation on HTML and CSS, with a heavy focus on responsive, mobile-first design. While I have been focusing on getting a depper understanding of pure CSS, I have used Bootstrap, and have also done some exploring with SASS and LESS.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fab fa-js"></i></h3>
                    <h4>Javascript</h4>
                    <p>I have worked through several books, and other resources, to build up my foundation of Javascript knowledge. While I have been focussing mostly on vanilla Javascript, I have also worked in several different Javascript frameworks.</p>

                    <h4>Git</h4>
                    <p>Many of my projects are hosted on GitHub, both for convenience of hosting on GitHub Pages, but also as a way to keep track of my progress over time, and a great way to share my projects with others. I have also used git within BASH, and a few other versions of Git.</p>

                    <h4>React</h4>
                    <p>I have made several Single Page Applications using React. I have worked both independently and collaboratively in React, fully embracing the modular nature of the framework.</p>

                   <h4>Drupal</h4>
                    <p>I am currently working with Drupal at Cornell, and have also begun work on some personal websites using Drupal. I have experience in expanding PHP template files, as well as the administrative side of Drupal. I have also used a few other CMSs.</p>

                    <p>I am always seeking opportunities to learn something new. I have been working through books and lessons to learn a variety of languages including Ruby, Go, Assembly, and much more. My <a href="https://github.com/JSmurf/misc-learning">"Misc Learning" GitHub repo</a> is a great place to see what I've been working on.</p>

            <p>
                I am currently working as a Drupal webmaster at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. In my current role, I am responsible for staying in contact with the several content managers that we have, ensuring they have all of the resources they need to be successful, as well as expanding the template in any places necessary to meet any and all needs. I have been working on template updates for departments such as Alumni, Research, and the Animal Health Diagnostic Center.

                    <p>
                        I created a new template for the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine's Alumni web page. I worked with Alumni Affairs and Development to create new styles that captured the vision of their staff.

                    <p>
                        I created a calculator originally for the freeCodeCamp front end certification. This was something that I put together quickly, and the original version is still available on codepen.io. However, a few years later I totally reworked this to look and feel closer to my original vision.
